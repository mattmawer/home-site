My professional life revolves around formulating comprehensible answers to complex questions. I spent over a decade in-or-around academia before joining the Civil Service as a social researcher in the UK Department for Education (DfE). I am currently on secondment to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), jointly running the social science evidence team in the Environmental Land Management (ELM) division.

### **And before the Civil Service?**
Prior to joining the Civil service, I was based at [The Association of Commonwealth Universities](https://www.acu.ac.uk/) (ACU), the world’s first and oldest international university network. With a small team of colleagues, I analysed the outcomes of a £25m per annum government-funded scholarship program – the UK’s Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships – for individual recipients and societies; in addition to writing about scholarship programme outcomes, the state of evaluation practice, and the wider implications of higher education development programs.

From 2015-2017 I edited the blog series [*Measuring Success?*](https://www.acu.ac.uk/about-us/blog/measuring-success), which drew together expert contributions on analysing scholarship programs and aimed to facilitate dialogue between the various government agencies, private foundations, and academic researchers working in the sector. I have also sat on various international working groups concerned with international higher education, development, and research approaches, such as the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Facility’s expert working group and the Donor Harmonization Group of agencies and researchers involved in higher education development cooperation.

In the increasingly hazy and distant past, I was an academic researcher at Coventry University (where I completed my PhD) and latterly King's College London. I specialised in education technology applications and understanding students' perspectives on higher education and have been involved in a variety of rather interesting projects funded variously by the European Commission, Leverhulme Trust, and UK Quality Assurance Agency. The outputs from my academic work - both while in academia and at the ACU - are listed on the [publications] (/Matt-Mawer-publications.pdf) page.
